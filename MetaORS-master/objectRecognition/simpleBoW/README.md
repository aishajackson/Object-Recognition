## dataset and vlfeat

### dataset
Click to download dataset for [cars](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vbhbd3q7x7aaojt/cars.zip?dl=0) and [faces](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yxcguhhibwmyodk/faces.zip?dl=0).
>> Note: This dataset is taken from Caltech 101

### vlfeat
In the implementation, you will need to use [vlfeat](http://www.vlfeat.org/index.html). You can either:  
- install from the official website by yourself, or
- use the [old version](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vx3bsddsf8qvwbo/vlfeat.zip?dl=0)

## folder structure
Once you have dataset and library ready, please arrange your working space, so you have structure like this:  
--simpleBoW/    
 |--cars/  
 |--faces/  
 |--vlfeat/   
 |--scripts/   
 |--README.md     
 |--mytraining.m  
 |--mytesting.m  
 
and you are good to go!
